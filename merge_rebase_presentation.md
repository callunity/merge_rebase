Merge and rebase strategies for shared repositories

Merging keeps history obvious by keeping track of what was changed and when. This is particularly useful for reasoning about what actually happened in a repository's history.

  The downside is that there are a lot of merge commits all over the repository, and sometimes it's still difficult to reason about what actually happened.
