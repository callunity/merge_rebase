# Merge and rebase strategies for shared repositories
presentation by Heather Armstrong for GSI meeting on January 30, 2017



Merging keeps history obvious by keeping track of what was changed and when. This is particularly useful for reasoning about what actually happened in a repository's history.

  The downside is that there are a lot of merge commits all over the repository, and sometimes it's still difficult to reason about what actually happened.
